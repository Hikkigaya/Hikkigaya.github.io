PDF vs Traditional Books

This is a discussion… no let me correct myself, this is a WAR that has been going on for as long as the world has been in existence. I'm totally exaggerating by the way.

When I started reading books there were only paper books. I'm sure digital formats were present at the time but I'm talking about a time when computer in my country were unheard of… mobile phones were witch craft… and smart phones would have proven that you were the incarnation of Terminator.

The point is, there is a generation that never had a digital format to read from and there is a generation which has seen both side by side. The generation which is going to never see a paper back is yet to come. But I hope it never does.

There is sense of joy and happiness in reading from a physical book. The latest goober like the Amazon Kindle and such are trying to replicate the feeling of paper with the added benefit of reading a digital book. 

Yes, I said it. There are benefits of reading from digital formats. I don't like e-books… or pdfs…whatever. But there are benefits non-the-less. 

First and foremost, they are cheap. Second for most, they are small. Like so small thousands can fits in the tip of my thumb… I talking about having books in a Flash Drive. Third of all, I can print them any time I want. Thug life.

The benefits of physical books on the other hand is that I feel more connected to the story… I don't know about you though. One more thing, when I buy a physical book I actually read it. When I download a digital book, for free… thug life, I read it… never. I don't about you though.

I did read ["Digital Fortress"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Fortress) and five parts of "Harry Potter" without paying for them, thug life.

In the end, as an excuse for my thug life hacks, I didn't had any money at the time. I spent it all on physical books.
