The longer I stay awake, The more stuff I want to do

For the past few months I have been observing myself and I have come to a decisive conclusion, I am lazy when I am fresh.

The longer I stay awake, the lower my energy levels go -and what do you know- the more I want to do stuff which I have been putting off.

This is a stranger phenomina and if ever a researcher happens to read this blog of mine, I suggest he/she looks into this phenomina. It's strange and amazing at the same time.

Putting it in the words of Jhony Bravo "I sickend by curious."

This is all for now. See you people (none) late.
